        <h3>Give us a little insight into your photography background?</h3>
        <p>Iâ€™m a 37 year old hobbyist that started taking photography seriously only about 9 months ago.
        Last fall, my now wife and I took my 10 year old to this artsy Halloween parade, and I was really disappointed with the low light limitations of my camera phone. 
        I had an old Canon AE-1 in high school and college, and I was curious to see if that early interest in photography was still there. So I decided to cautiously dive back into the SLR world with a cheap, used Nikon D60 that I soon realized was a bit too long in the tooth. 
        A few months later, I upgraded bodies, bought a 35mm prime lens, and started carrying my camera absolutely everywhere.
